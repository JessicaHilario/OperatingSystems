Project 1/HM 1

For this project, we utilized many online resources and class 
notes to build a shell within a shell. We are asked to use 
the commands cp, ls -l, and kill. We also implemented an exit
function to easily exit out of the shell.

To run this program, run the ./Aprog and the shell will pop up
and ready to run.

For the contribution of this prject, Joel and Jessica worked on 
the project collaboratively doing research online and combining
the work we have found online to compile into one code. Jessica 
developed the loop for the continuous shell and the command 
validation as well as having the working directory change. Joel 
did the documentation of the document and contributed to the 
research that was implemented in this code.
